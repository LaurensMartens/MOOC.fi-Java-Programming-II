# MOOC.fi-Java-Programming-II
These are projects made during my online course Java Programming II by the University of Helsinki.

PART-08 Week 8 started with a short recap of all acquired knowledge of the first course, after which we explored hash maps, comparing objects, overriding .equals(), .hashcode() and creating hash maps with ArrayList values.
