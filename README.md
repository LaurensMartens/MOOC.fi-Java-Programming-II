# MOOC.fi-Java-Programming-II
##These are projects made during my online course Java Programming II by the University of Helsinki.

**PART-08** Week 8 started with a short recap of all acquired knowledge of the first course, after which we explored hash maps, comparing objects, overriding .equals(), .hashcode() and creating hash maps with ArrayList values.

**PART-09** Week 9 was mainly focused on inheritance, explaining the concept of and creating an interface, inheritance hierarchy and object polymorphism.

**PART-10** Week 10 introduced handling collections as streams (.filter, .map, .reduce, .forEach, .sorted...), using the comparable class, advanced sorting with streams, using StringBuilder, enums and iterator.
